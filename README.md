# Learning

I had often planned to file structured topics and references in order to create sustainable knowledge. Unfortunately, I have always been involved in concept questions for a possible solution of a knowledge and learning platform. In order to continue positively from this insight, I decided to start unstructured and to collect insights in the structuring of information. In the following I describe my goals.

## Creating relations

My interests lie in the areas of information security, machine learning and brain computer interfaces. In addition, there are some related fields that interest me selectively. These include Computational Linguistics, Internet of Things and Data Science. There are lots of relevant topic connected to all of these topics. I want to find a structure to connect these fields by relate papers, software and other information to each another

## Play with knowledge

In lots of papers and books, the subject is highly theoretical. With the help of containers and clouds, it is getting easier to prototype and experiment with complex structures. I want to play with the subjects in a sustainable matter.

## Make learning effective

Often, I deal with lots of different formats and media by consuming knowledge. In most cases, I wish I had a pen or a way to create a direct reference to make notes or develop ideas. Especially when working with a smartphone or a book, I don't have the tools in place to make suitable notes.

# Method

I start creating markdown files, to describe the topic. After a summary, I start with the references. I work with (TODO), (FIXME), (IDEA) and (NOTE) to find stuff.

## Editor

I use [Atom] and the plugin [Todo Show].
