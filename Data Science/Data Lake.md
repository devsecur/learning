# Data Lake

NOTE. I was very skeptical when I first heard the word _data lake_. Is it a good idea to create a space with unstructured data? Is the collection of data a goal itself? How should I start with analysis?

NOTE. Now, I think there are some really interesting products, papers and approaches to profit by a data lake.
