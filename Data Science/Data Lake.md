# Data Lake

NOTE. I was very skeptical when I first heard the word _data lake_. Is it a good idea to create a space with unstructured data? Is the collection of data a goal itself? How should I start with analysis?

NOTE. Now, I think there are some really interesting products, papers and approaches to profit by a data lake.

### Kylo

> Kylo is a data lake management software platform and framework for enabling scalable enterprise-class data lakes on big data technologies such as Teradata, Apache Spark and/or Hadoop. [1]

TODO I want to play around with Kylo. Therefore, I have started with a already existing docker-compose file [2]. Starting with this docker compose file, I want to create an own instance [3].
